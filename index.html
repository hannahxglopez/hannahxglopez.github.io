        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Hi, I'm Hannah! I am currently a second year undergrad at 
        <a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/"> George Fox University</a>. I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in 
        cybersecurity. I am currently learning website building for fun :). I love all things tech and am proficient in 
        Java and Python as well as some python packages such as matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn. However, I am always 
        trying to learn new coding languages and the packages that go along with them. I am now actively seeking internship 
        opportunities where I can collaborate on meaningful projects and keep leveling up my skills. When Iâ€™m not coding, 
        youâ€™ll usually find me traveling, playing/learning a musical instrument, or curating a playlist for any mood.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/hannahxglopez/world-happiness-25"> World Happiness Data Project</a></h2>
      <p>This project ended up being rushed due to previously bad data and not enough time, and I should have used a regression model instead. I also never 
      updated the README file in the actual project files after changing the dataset. I still however, was able to observe some valuable information through 
      the figures I created using both matplotlib and pandas, like the figure shown above.</p>
